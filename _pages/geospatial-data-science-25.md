# Course Description

Satellites provide a picture of the entire world and in this picture, it captures a lot that is happening in the world; Farmers growing crops, cities building roads, people migrating places, rivers changing paths, water bodies changing colour, forests being cut and much more. In this course, we explore how we capture these changes through methods in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Systems methods. We would like to derive insights about different aspects of our lives, both in urban and rural settings. We would like to understand how cities function, where does the waste go, where does the water come from, how do people travel in the city, etc. In rural areas, we would like to understand the village’s land use, optimization of agricultural practices, development of new projects, etc. We will work with a combination of publicly available geospatial datasets and satellite images for various projects in the space. This information will empower decision makers, governments to make policies that keep the interconnectedness of the entire ecological system in mind and the public to take decisions regarding their lifestyles and vocations.
