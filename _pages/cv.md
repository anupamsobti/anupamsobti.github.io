Prior to joining Plaksha, I was a postdoc researcher at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/">Microsoft Research India</a> (MSR). At MSR, I worked with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/scai/">Societal Impact for Cloud and AI (SCAI)</a> group working on applied ML/systems problems in sustainability. Specifically, I worked on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vasudha/">Project Vasudha</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dependableiot/">Dependable IoT</a> with collaborators from Azure Energy group, Ashok Leyland, etc.

Before this, I was a PhD scholar at IIT Delhi supervised by [Prof. M. Balakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mbala/) and [Dr. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/) where I worked on building assistive technology for the visually impaired (<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/mavi">MAVI</a>).

I have also worked at the chip-level for silicon bringup and pre-silicon simulations at [Qualcomm India](https://www.qualcomm.com/home).
