### Open Positions

Please see [here](/open_positions)

### Consultancy

I am keen to collaborate with startups and industries in the healthcare and sustainability domains. I am open to

- Short term projects where the only input required is my time and you already have a team working on the project full time. This is best if you're stuck somewhere and would like an expert to look at the problem from fresh eyes offering expertise in computer vision, applied machine learning/deep learning or embedded systems.
- Long term collaborations where we work together on pushing the state of the art be it in the form of an algorithm or a device or a mix of both. The project here is typically a mix of how exciting the project is from a research perspective and how relevant it would be for your company. I'm looking for domain expertise from your side while offering a deeper literature understanding as well as solutions in ML/embedded systems space.

### Student Projects

There are a few different kind of student projects I offer with a few limitations on the people who would be eligible.

- **Plaksha Students**: I offer short 2-4 month as well as longer 6 month internships for working on projects I already have or a project that you propose in the healthcare/sustainability space. This could also be a part of the ILGC projects. Please send me an email with the subject: "Plaksha Student: Project Application" describing why you'd like to work with me and optionally a document (1-2 pages) descibing the project idea you'd like to work on.
- **6-month part time internship**: Only students who will be able to come to Plaksha campus at least bi-weekly will be eligible for this internship. This is ideally someone who studies in a university in or near Mohali. This internship will involve working on a research/engineering project in collaboration with other team members. You may work on the internship while your coursework is ongoing or if you have an "off" semester. Please send you CV and a statement of purpose to my email with the subject "Long Term Internship Application".
- **Research Fellowship**: The research fellowship is a 1-2 year program for graduates. This is ideal for someone looking to i) get research experience working in the area of applied ML/embedded systems ii) start a technology business in the area of health/sustainability and would like to work in a small group to check feasibility of the idea and perhaps develop an MVP. Note that even in the case you want to do the latter, publishing findings in conferences/journals is expected.
