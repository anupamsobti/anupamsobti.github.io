I am interested in applied research that drives sustainable communities by reducing the information gap among various stakeholders, e.g., information about heat islands in the city, or information about crop health to an insurance company. I use techniques from computer vision, machine learning and embedded systems to design these systems. Recent focus in the group has been using techniques in self supervised learning to build scalable and generalizable models that can be applied to areas in urban planning and agriculture.

I lead the [Geospatial Computer Vision Group](geospatial-computer-vision) at [Plaksha University](https://plaksha.edu.in), Mohali, India. Our vision is to develop state of the art geospatial intelligence for supporting domains across urban climate, agriculture, and water security. Have a look at our latest publications to know more.

I am on the lookout for industries, startups, and students for collaboration towards these goals. If you think I can help, please [get in touch](/get_in_touch/).
