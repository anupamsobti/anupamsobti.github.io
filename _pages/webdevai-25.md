In this course, we plan to learn web development but with AI! We will focus on 4 rough modules 
i) Prompt engineering for generating static websites 
ii) Prompt engineering for designing databases and integrating them with websites. 
iii) We'll then include LLMs for our websites, including structured format generation and adding the LLM magic to our websites 
iv) Finally, we'll touch upon agentic and RAG frameworks, building complex web apps with a mix of structured and unstructured data.

The course expects you to have a working knowledge of Python.
